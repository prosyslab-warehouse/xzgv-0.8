INSTALL - information about compilation etc.
--------------------------------------------

You'll need these libraries installed:

- GTK+		(>=1.2.x)
- Imlib		(1.x)
- libjpeg
- libpng
- libtiff

(Also, the `imlib-config' and `gtk-config' programs must be on your
path - this shouldn't be a problem though, any valid installations
should have those.)

If you use Linux, your distribution is likely to come with all of
these libraries, but be sure to install any relevant `development'
packages too (e.g. SuSE's GTK+ and Imlib dev packages were `gtkdev'
and `imlibdev' last time I looked, and Debian's are `libgtk1.2-dev'
and `gdk-imlib-dev' at the time of writing), or you may not be able to
*compile* a program using the libraries.

If you don't use Linux, or need more up-to-date copies than your
distribution carries, check out http://www.gtk.org/ and
ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/imlib/ - they're the most
recent URLs I have for GTK+ and Imlib1.


Anyway, once GTK+, Imlib, libjpeg, libpng, and libtiff are in place,
you'll want to have a look at `config.mk' to see if there's anything
there you want to change.

(In particular, if you're compiling on a non-x86 machine, or with
something other than gcc, you'll have to comment out the `INTERP_MMX'
line. If you don't have the faintest idea what I'm on about, leave it
alone. :-))

After that, it's just `make' then (as root) `make install'. This
compiles xzgv, then installs it and its documentation (both info files
and man page).


Note that the only platform I'm usually sure xzgv compiles on is
Linux/x86 - if you get it to compile ok on others I'd appreciate
knowing about it. (There are good reasons why zgv is pretty
non-portable, alas, but xzgv shouldn't have those problems.) I'd
especially like to know how it plays on non-x86 non-Linux platforms.
I've had these reports for previous xzgv versions (only the most
recent report for any given platform is included):

xzgv ver	OS (platform)		How it went

0.7		Solaris 8 (UltraSparc)	compiled/installed ok
0.7		IRIX 6.5.8		compiled/installed ok (with gcc)
0.7		MacOS X 10.2		compiled ok; needed X, Fink, and
					 required libs (also `dlcompat'),
					 and "-I /sw/include" in CFLAGS
0.6		Linux (PPC)		weird thumbnail problem [1]
0.6		Linux (UltraSparc)	compiled/installed ok
0.6		Linux (Alpha)		same problem as PPC, and an
					even stranger window-width
					oddity [1]
0.5		FreeBSD (x86?)		compiled ok except install-info
0.5		HP-UX 10.20 (PA-RISC)	compiled ok except install-info;
					 required gawk for man page and
					 GNU fileutils for install

Good luck!

bugs.
