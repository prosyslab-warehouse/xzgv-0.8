INSTALL for libmmx.

Step 1: Edit the top-level Makefile to choose your installation directories

	INCDIR: You will need to have write permission to this directory.
		For a site-wide installation, you should choose a directory
		which is executable by those you want to use the library.  It
		should also be on a standard include search path if possible
		to avoid having to tell everyone which -I switch to include.

		For private installations, you should first see if there is
		a current site-wide distribution.  Assuming there isn't, you
		should pick a directory where you have read/write permissions.

		The default is /usr/local/include


Step 2: Decide what to install

	The targets you may want to give to the top-level Makefile are:
		examples	Build and run the test app "Examples/testit"
		install		Copy the the header file to INCDIR.
		all		Do all the above

		The default target is "all".


Applications should #include <mmx.h> if INCDIR is on the include search path,
or #include "mmx.h" if INCDIR is not.  In the latter case, the -I may be
required to inform the compiler where to look for the header file.
