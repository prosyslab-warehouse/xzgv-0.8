1997-99 by H. Dietz and R. Fisher

97-98*	R.Fisher	Early versions
980501	R.Fisher	Original Release
980611*	H.Dietz		Rewrite, correctly implementing inlines, and
	R.Fisher	 including direct register accesses.
980616	R.Fisher	Release of 980611 as 980616.
980714	R.Fisher	Minor corrections to Makefile, etc.
980715	R.Fisher	mmx_ok() now prevents optimizer from using
			 clobbered values.
			mmx_ok() now checks if cpuid instruction is
			 available before trying to use it.
980726*	R.Fisher	mm_support() searches for AMD 3DNow, Cyrix
			 Extended MMX, and standard MMX.  It returns a
			 value which is positive if any of these are
			 supported, and can be masked with constants to
			 see which.  mmx_ok() is now a call to this
980726*	R.Fisher	Added i2r support for shift functions
980919	R.Fisher	Fixed AMD extended feature recognition bug.
980921	R.Fisher	Added definition/check for _MMX_H.
			Added "float s[2]" to mmx_t for use with
			  3DNow and EMMX.  So same mmx_t can be used.
981013	R.Fisher	Fixed cpuid function 1 bug (looked at wrong reg)
			Fixed psllq_i2r error in mmxtest.c
990113*	R.Fisher	First shot at Cyrix recognition bug
			Put union on an 8-byte boundary
990114	R.Fisher	First short at fixing the tracing on _i2r macros
990122	R.Fisher	Another pass at the Cyrix detection.
			History and Acknowledgments sections removed
			from header file.
990123	R.Fisher	Change mmx.h tracing macros and mmxtest.c to work with
			compilers without "ll" format in printf's.
			Change _i2r TRACE macro to case "imm" to an "mmx_t" on
			assignment.
990124	R.Fisher	Change arguments in movq's around psllq_i2r and
			constant arguments in ps*lq to LL in mmxtest.c.
990208	R.Fisher	Change argument type for i2r macros for egcs.
990325	R.Fisher	Change % to %% in r2r macros before register name.
990416	R.Fisher	Added optional CPP definition in Makefile
			Changed "%%" to "%" in _r2r macro def'n.
